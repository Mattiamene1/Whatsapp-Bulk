# Script made by Mattia Meneghin https://github.com/Mattiamene1 https://mattiameneghin.tk
# Python Bulk message for all the contacts in Business WA account
# Idea: Avoid spam block: If the receiver hasn't got your WA contact already saved, it won't never receive your broadcast list message
# Send Message one-to-one with pywhatkit library, using csv file that contains all the numbers
# Good way to use it is to uninstall pywhatkit using the command    pip uninstall pywhatkit
# Then re-intall it using                                           pip install pywhatkit
# clear the cache of your default browser (I suggest you to use firefox)
# Do the log in to your whatsapp sender account
# Run the script with the command                                   python3 bulk_msg.py
# Attention: During the execution don't press any key or use the device
