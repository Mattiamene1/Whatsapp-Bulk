# Whatsapp-Bulk
Bulk messages for Whatsapp web

## What Whatshapp-Bulk do
Whatsapp-Bulk through the [pywhatkit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/) library can send a message to several contacts using Whatsapp web

## Idea
Avoid spam block: If the receiver hasn't got your Whatsapp contact already saved, it won't never receive your broadcast list message.
We want to send Message one-to-one, using either array or csv file that contains all the numbers

## How to use it
1) Clear the cache of your default browser (I suggest you to use firefox)

2) Do the log in to your whatsapp sender account

3) Install pywhatkit every time you need it
  - ```pip install pywhatkit```
  
4) Launch the pyhon script choosen
  - ```python3 bulk_msg.py```
  or
  - ```python3 bulk_fixed_list.py```
  
5) Uninstall it using
  - ```pip uninstall pywhatkit```
  
***ATTENTION: During the execution don't press any key or use the device, otherwise it won't work***
